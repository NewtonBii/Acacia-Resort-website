<p>The rooms are extremely comfortable, equipped with warm and precious materials and personalized with authentic antiques expertly chosen one by one in the many markets of Tuscany.
This passion for detail contributes to the intimate, tranquil atmosphere which transforms each room into a pleasant refuge, in a place where guests can relax after a day spent touring and admiring the many beautiful landscapes which cradled the Renaissance.
Each bedroom has  been individually designed in a fresh  concept mixing tradition, precious fabrics, period furnitures, Maasai vintage design, original photos, prints and paintings.
Rooms  are light and comfortable and well appointed with a writing desk, wireless internet access and flat screen TV's.  Rooms overlooking the front have double soundproof windows.</p>
